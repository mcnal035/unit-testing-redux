# Unit Testing Redux Reducers

There are two reducers in this project and two files that will be used to test the reducers. For base mode, you should only need to modify the files in the `test` folder.

## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm test`

You should have two passing tests at this point.

## Requirements

See the code comments in the `tests/counter.reducer.test.js` and `tests/name.reducer.test.js` files.
